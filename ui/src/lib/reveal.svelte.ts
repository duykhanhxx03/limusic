// Chunked reveal for open-ended card grids.

// `.card-grid` already sets `content-visibility: auto`, so a card the user has not scrolled to
// costs no layout and no paint. What it still costs is the mount: a `MediaCard` carries a menu
// component with several deriveds of its own, and a large library builds every one of them in one
// synchronous pass on the tab click. So render a chunk, and reveal the next when a sentinel below
// the grid comes into range. Same shape as the playlist page's continuation sentinel, minus the
// network.
//
// Below `MIN_TO_CHUNK` nothing is held back: a grid you can see the end of gains nothing from this
// and a sentinel is one more observer for no reason. Same call the queue panel makes
// (`QueueList.svelte`, WINDOW_ABOVE).
